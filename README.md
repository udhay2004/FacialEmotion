# Facial Expression Recognition 🎭  

This project is a **deep learning-based Facial Expression Recognition system** that predicts emotions from facial images using **TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Detects emotions such as **Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, etc.**  
- Uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on facial datasets.  
- **Streamlit-powered UI** for easy interaction.  
- **Image upload support** for real-time emotion detection.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- **OpenCV & NumPy**  
- **Streamlit**  

## 📌 Installation  

1. Clone the repository:
